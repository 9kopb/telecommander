# Telecommander

The experimental full-featured command line client for Telegram is in development.

It uses [enricostara](http://github.com/enricostara)'s [telegram.link](http://github.com/enricostara/telegram.link) to connect to Telegram and [chjj](http://github.com/chjj)'s [blessed](http://github.com/chjj/blessed) for the UI.

At the moment you can use Telecommander to register or login into telegram. Yep, that's it for now, but stay tuned!
